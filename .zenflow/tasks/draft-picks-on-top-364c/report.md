## Summary

- Updated the depth chart slot editor so Draft/Trade/FA placeholders are shown at the top of the panel (above roster and free-agent lists) when a depth-row “player card” is selected.
- Limited free-agent lists to the top 5 by default (sorted by OVR) in both the slot editor and the right-hand “Roster & FA Market” panel, while keeping search available to reveal the full set of matching free agents.
- Adjusted styling to support the new “showing top N of M” helper text and updated the existing depth-chart E2E test to search within the FA panel after cutting a player, aligning the test with the new top-5 behavior.
