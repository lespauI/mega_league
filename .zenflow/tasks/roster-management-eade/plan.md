## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Requirements
<!-- chat-id: b01c9885-8b2a-4b9f-90ef-8425fe822330 -->

Your job is to generate a Product Requirements Document based on the feature description,

First, analyze the provided feature definition and determine unclear aspects.  For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
      - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

Ask up to 5 most priority clarifications to the user. Then, create the document following this template:

```
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]


## User Stories*


### User Story 1 - [Brief Title]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

## Requirements*

## Success Criteria*

```

Save the PRD into `{@artifacts_path}/requirements.md`.

Status: Completed. See `.zenflow/tasks/roster-management-eade/requirements.md`.

### [x] Step: Technical Specification
<!-- chat-id: df991ac4-d4f7-48af-aa97-dfd48302df78 -->

Based on the PRD in `{@artifacts_path}/requirements.md`, create a detailed technical specification to be used by a coding agent to implement the feature. Follow this template:

```
# Technical Specification: [FEATURE]

## Technical Context
Language/Version, primary dependencies, etc

## Technical Implementation Brief

Summarize key technical decisions for implementing the feature. Make sure they take into account the existing code as much as possible.

## Source Code Structure

## Contracts

Define addition or changes in data models, DB schemas, APIs, code interfaces etc

## Delivery Phases

Define several incremental deliverables for the feature. Each should be a minimal viable product testable end-to-end.

## Verification Strategy 

Define how the coding agent can verify each deliverable it creates. Provide instructions for the agent to perform the verification using available tools (lint/test commands, bash commands) and create helper scripts and tools for more complex result verification.
The verification for each deliverable should be executable by a coding agent using built-in capabilities (lint and test commands from the project, bash commands), pre-generated helper scripts or MCP servers. Research and add to the spec:

- MCP servers that should be installed to help the agent with the verification 

- helper scripts that need to be generated in the first phases of the plan to verify complex scenarios that can't be covered by the tests in the project's test framework(s)

- any sample input artifact(s) that are required for verification. Note if these artifacts can be a) generated by the agent; b) discovered by the agent on line; c) must be provided by the user.
```

Save the spec to `{@artifacts_path}/spec.md`.

Status: Completed. See `.zenflow/tasks/roster-management-eade/spec.md`.

### [x] Step: Implementation Plan
<!-- chat-id: 9ef309d5-3d2a-4e50-8e76-ac34563749e8 -->

Based on the technical spec in `{@artifacts_path}/spec.md`, create a detailed task plan and update `{@artifacts_path}/plan.md`. Each task should have task definition, references to contracts to be used/implemented, deliverable definition and verification instructions.

Format each task as 
```
### [ ] Step: <task_name>
Task instructions
```

"Step:" prefix is important, do not omit it!

- Deliverable: Releasing a player updates roster and Cap Summary in real time.
- Verification: Manual modal preview; console assert of cap increase equals previewed savings.

### [x] Step: Free Agent Signing Flow (Offer Modal)
<!-- chat-id: 256cba22-b39c-4559-b886-66e6558dffad -->
Task instructions
- Definition: Add “Make Offer” for FAs; implement `js/ui/modals/offerModal.js` with years/salary/bonus inputs and cap preview; block signing if `capAvailable < year1CapHit`; on confirm, sign player and mark `isFreeAgent = false`.
- Contracts: `simulateSigning`; warning if offer < 90% of desired terms.
- Deliverable: Signing updates Active Roster and Cap Summary; warning shown when low offer.
- Verification: Manual offer at desired values shows expected Year 1 Cap Hit and reduces cap accordingly.

### [x] Step: Dead Money & IR Tabs + Trade Quick
<!-- chat-id: 2e5cc953-d333-4bb9-a65f-4b348d1f44d6 -->

Task instructions
- Definition: Implement `scripts/verify_cap_math.py`, `scripts/smoke_roster_cap_tool.sh`, and `scripts/fixtures/cap_scenarios.json`. Generate `output/tiny_teams.csv` if missing for tiny tests.
- Contracts: Script I/O per spec; relies on same formulas as `capMath`.
- Deliverable: Scripts produce `output/cap_tool_verification.json` and smoke-check that `docs/roster_cap_tool/` contains required assets and serves via local http.server.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/verify_cap_math.py`; `bash scripts/smoke_roster_cap_tool.sh`.

- Contracts: None; aligns with PRD “UI/UX Requirements”.
- Deliverable: Polished UI with sticky Cap Summary, color coding, responsive layout.
- Verification: Manual checks on desktop/tablet/mobile widths.


### [x] Step: Visual bug in roster
<!-- chat-id: ee04d146-5b6f-4ca6-9469-7dcab0da45e3 -->

Fix: Table header appeared below the first player row due to an incorrect sticky offset in CSS (`th { top: calc(58px + 44px) }`). Since the table scrolls inside `.table-container` (overflow: auto), the header should stick at the top of that container, not offset for the page header/tabs.

Changes:
- Updated `docs/roster_cap_tool/css/styles.css` to set `th { position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 2; }` and removed the larger offsets in the responsive section.

Verification:
- Open Active Roster: header now renders as the first row and remains correctly sticky within the table container while scrolling.

### [x] Step: Make all table columns sortable
<!-- chat-id: 5fdd1b9c-3ae7-4d1a-8f22-a4b8b1e0c0e7 -->

Add full-table sorting across all headers for Active Roster and Free Agents.

Changes:
- Updated `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js` to:
  - Define header metadata with keys for every column.
  - Add click handlers to all headers to toggle sort direction.
  - Implement robust sort value mapping for each key (player name, cap hit, dead money, contract value, FA year, etc.).
  - Keep Action column sortable (groups by extension eligibility for Active; stable for FAs).

Verification:
- Click any header in Active Roster or Free Agents; rows re-sort accordingly; clicking again toggles sort direction.

### [x] Step: In projection the Roster cap for DAL
<!-- chat-id: 9467ffe8-6ca1-467f-b1f8-3f8bbfc6053e -->

Issue: DAL showed Roster Cap $321,560,000 and Cap Space -$17M in Projections (Year 1). Root cause: Year 1 used a straight sum of all non-FA DAL players’ `capHit` (66 players = $321.56M) and compared it to `capRoom` ($304.2M), ignoring the in‑game baseline totals (`capSpent`/`capAvailable`). That mismatch produced an impossible negative space mid‑season.

Fix implemented:
- Anchored Year 1 (current season) in `projectTeamCaps()` to team snapshot:
  - `totalSpent₀ = team.capSpent + deltaFromMoves`
  - `capSpace₀ = team.capAvailable − deltaFromMoves`
  - `deadMoney₀` reflects only new scenario moves; `rosterCap₀ = max(0, totalSpent₀ − deadMoney₀)`
- Left future years (Year 2+) as roster‑sum projections with conversion and dead‑money schedules.
- Added a UI note in Projections: “Year 1 is anchored to the in‑game snapshot (capSpent/capAvailable). Roster Cap is derived; Dead Money reflects only scenario moves.”

Files changed:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js` (Year 1 anchoring logic in `projectTeamCaps`)
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/projections.js` (explanatory note)

Verification:
- DAL totals now show `Cap Space` equal to the in‑game `capAvailable` for Year 1 and never negative; applying a release/sign adjusts by the move deltas. Future years remain projection‑based.

### [x] Step: Dead money
<!-- chat-id: 5dd9e963-f8d0-48b3-b800-6400bb0680d6 -->

Dead money is split across two years and displayed in the Dead Money tab. Added a manual baseline per-team editor (This Year and Next Year) with localStorage persistence. Ledger rows now include current and next year values; totals show moves-only and combined with baseline.

Changes:
- UI: `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/deadMoneyTable.js` now shows This Year, Next Year, Total columns, a baseline editor with Save, and totals.
- State: `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/state.js` added baseline dead money getters/setters and persistence under `rosterCap.deadMoneyBaseline`.
- Moves: `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/modals/releaseModal.js` and `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js` now record `penaltyCurrentYear`, `penaltyNextYear`, and `penaltyTotal` in the dead money ledger.

Verification:
- Open Dead Money tab. Enter baseline values and Save; they persist per team and totals update.
- Release/Trade a player; row shows both years; totals reflect changes.

### [x] Step: Add posobility to trade for the player
<!-- chat-id: a74fcb3f-75a0-4b6b-b167-24506a9355a1 -->

Implemented Trade In flow:
- Added header button to open Trade In modal.
- Search players across other teams; show acquiring Year 1 (salary only).
- On confirm: move player to selected team, set `contractBonus = 0`, set `capHit` to salary-only, and add `tradeIn` move so cap summary updates.
- Cap math: `simulateTradeIn()` and support for `tradeIn` in `calcCapSummary` and `projectTeamCaps`.

Verification:
- Open the app, click Trade In, search/select a player from another team. Confirm. Active Roster updates; Cap Summary reduces by the shown Year 1 amount. Projections show no bonus proration for the acquired player.

### [x] Step: Add possitions colors and filter
<!-- chat-id: 5d7392a6-eecc-4997-9f93-52aba35c66be -->

Implemented:
- Expanded position badge colors in `docs/roster_cap_tool/css/styles.css` for QB, RB/HB, FB, WR, TE, full OL (LT/LG/C/RG/RT), DL (LE/RE/DE/DT/DL/EDGE), LBs (LOLB/MLB/ROLB/OLB/LB), secondary (CB/FS/SS/S/DB), and specialists (K/P/LS).
- Added filter bars to Active Roster and Free Agents panels (`index.html`) and styled chips (`.filters-bar`, `.chip`).
- Added position filter state with localStorage persistence in `js/state.js` (`getPositionFilter`, `setPositionFilter`).
- Rendered filter chips and applied filtering in `js/ui/rosterTabs.js` for both tables; chips toggle per-position; “All/Reset” clears filter.

Verification:
- Open Active Roster and Free Agents: position chips render above tables; clicking chips filters rows; clearing shows all; selections persist across re-renders and tab switches. Badges display with the new colors.

### [x] Step: Contract over the years
<!-- chat-id: 96a4302b-16be-42e1-8309-3f39a7fd0a25 -->

Implemented approximate multi-year contract allocation to improve projections.

Changes:
- capMath: Enhanced `projectPlayerCapHits()` to derive out-year cap hits by distributing base salary (`contractSalary/contractLength`) and prorating bonuses (up to 5 years). When `contractBonus` is missing, infer proration from `capReleasePenalty` (treated as remaining bonus). When `contractSalary` is missing, infer base from current `capHit` minus proration.
- UI: Updated Projections note to clarify approximations and inference rules.

Files changed:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js`
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/projections.js`

Verification:
- Open `docs/roster_cap_tool/index.html` → Projections tab. Confirm:
  - Year 1 remains anchored to team snapshot.
  - Future years reflect base = totalSalary/length + bonus proration; players with missing fields still show reasonable out-year caps.
  - Smoke check players with zero `contractSalary`/`contractBonus` still contribute via inferred values.

### [x] Step: Dead Cap (Release) is incorect name
<!-- chat-id: 1e25f3b1-5802-4e0b-b2a1-b5e98a36a48e -->

Implemented label update:
- Active Roster table column renamed from "Dead Cap (Release)" to "Free cap after release" in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js:121` and row data-label in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js:204`.
- Placeholder header updated in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/main.js:44`.
Verification: Open the app; Active Roster table now displays the new column label; sorting and values unchanged (still uses `capReleaseNetSavings`).

### [x] Step: Projections improvements
<!-- chat-id: 1e2e4cf1-844c-4b45-9b29-f082ff5311fb -->

Projections now account for Rookie Reserve:
- Next year (Y+1): uses user-configured Draft Picks rookie reserve.
- Out years (Y+2+): assumes 1 pick per round by default.
- Default picks set to 1/round when no config exists.

UI changes:
- Removed the Projections tab/panel.
- Added a projection strip to the header Cap Summary showing Y+1/Y+2/Y+3 Cap Space after rookies.

Tech changes:
- `capMath.projectTeamCaps(..., years, opts)` accepts `opts.rookieReserveByYear` and adds it to future-year spending (i>0).
- `state.getDraftPicksForSelectedTeam()` defaults to 1 pick per round.
- `capSummary` computes a 3-year projection with rookie reserve and renders badges.

### [x] Step: UI fixes
<!-- chat-id: 76a40b52-860c-4a9c-8d05-f7d486fa55f7 -->

- Colorize LEDGE/REDGE (EDGE color) and MIKE/SAM/WILL (LB color).
- Update player info to show OVR and Age (remove height/weight).

Implementation:
- CSS: badge classes added for `.pos-LEDGE`, `.pos-REDGE`, `.pos-MIKE`, `.pos-SAM`, `.pos-WILL`.
- Ordering: added these roles to `POSITION_ORDER` for better chip sorting.
- Data: normalized `playerBestOvr`/`playerSchemeOvr` in player rows.
- UI: player row meta now renders `OVR {value} · Age {n}`.

Verification:
- Badges for the new roles display with colors in Active/FA tables.
- Player meta shows like `OVR 88 · Age 27` instead of `28y · 76 · 266 lb`.

### [x] Step: Raise the cap by 9% each year
<!-- chat-id: 91b21747-59c3-43ff-b0ac-a811cc71063a -->

Implemented annual cap growth in projections.

Changes:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js`: `projectTeamCaps` now applies a per-year cap growth rate (default 9%). For year i, `capRoom_i = capRoom_0 * (1 + rate)^i`. The function also accepts optional `opts.capGrowthRate` to override the default.
- Projections in the header now implicitly reflect the increased cap space for Y+1..Y+3 because `projectTeamCaps` returns year-specific `capRoom` and `capSpace`.

Verification:
- Open the app header projections and compare Y+1 cap space before/after a manual check: base cap ~304M becomes ~331M cap basis for Y+1; cap space reflects this growth after rookies and rollover adjustments.


### [x] Step:  Step: Need to rethink year+1 cap space
<!-- chat-id: 9afad340-15de-4e4a-af37-f42cd9fd7c54 -->

So the issue we have right now, the game didnt give us the real numbers so all our calculation is estimates.

But i can come into the game and see the real value of avaliable cap space for year+1
Lets imagene this case with dallas, our estimation fro year+1 is 33 millions, and its take into account all cap raize and rookie reserv.
But now we looking into the game and see 2027 cup avaliable = 800k. This means dallas has bigger rooki reserv, or already sign some players.
I want to allow my users to insert this value somhow and made adjustment in Prediction.


Implementation (updated per feedback):
- Removed the Y+1 cap override feature entirely (state, math, UI, persistence).
- Renamed the re-sign input label to "Resign budget" and added a hover hint: "Go to in game re-sign, and see how many money avaliabe nad adjust this to have proper calculations" in both the header strip and projections panel.

Files changed:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/state.js` (removed override state + getters/setters)
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js` (removed override handling)
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/capSummary.js` (removed override UI; renamed label + hint)
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/projections.js` (removed override; renamed label + hint)

Verification:
- Open `docs/roster_cap_tool/index.html`.
- Confirm there is no Y+1 override control in the header.
- Hover the "Resign budget" label or input to see the hint.
