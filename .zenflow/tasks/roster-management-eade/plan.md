## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Requirements
<!-- chat-id: b01c9885-8b2a-4b9f-90ef-8425fe822330 -->

Your job is to generate a Product Requirements Document based on the feature description,

First, analyze the provided feature definition and determine unclear aspects.  For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
      - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

Ask up to 5 most priority clarifications to the user. Then, create the document following this template:

```
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]


## User Stories*


### User Story 1 - [Brief Title]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

## Requirements*

## Success Criteria*

```

Save the PRD into `{@artifacts_path}/requirements.md`.

Status: Completed. See `.zenflow/tasks/roster-management-eade/requirements.md`.

### [x] Step: Technical Specification
<!-- chat-id: df991ac4-d4f7-48af-aa97-dfd48302df78 -->

Based on the PRD in `{@artifacts_path}/requirements.md`, create a detailed technical specification to be used by a coding agent to implement the feature. Follow this template:

```
# Technical Specification: [FEATURE]

## Technical Context
Language/Version, primary dependencies, etc

## Technical Implementation Brief

Summarize key technical decisions for implementing the feature. Make sure they take into account the existing code as much as possible.

## Source Code Structure

## Contracts

Define addition or changes in data models, DB schemas, APIs, code interfaces etc

## Delivery Phases

Define several incremental deliverables for the feature. Each should be a minimal viable product testable end-to-end.

## Verification Strategy 

Define how the coding agent can verify each deliverable it creates. Provide instructions for the agent to perform the verification using available tools (lint/test commands, bash commands) and create helper scripts and tools for more complex result verification.
The verification for each deliverable should be executable by a coding agent using built-in capabilities (lint and test commands from the project, bash commands), pre-generated helper scripts or MCP servers. Research and add to the spec:

- MCP servers that should be installed to help the agent with the verification 

- helper scripts that need to be generated in the first phases of the plan to verify complex scenarios that can't be covered by the tests in the project's test framework(s)

- any sample input artifact(s) that are required for verification. Note if these artifacts can be a) generated by the agent; b) discovered by the agent on line; c) must be provided by the user.
```

Save the spec to `{@artifacts_path}/spec.md`.

Status: Completed. See `.zenflow/tasks/roster-management-eade/spec.md`.

### [x] Step: Implementation Plan
<!-- chat-id: 9ef309d5-3d2a-4e50-8e76-ac34563749e8 -->

Based on the technical spec in `{@artifacts_path}/spec.md`, create a detailed task plan and update `{@artifacts_path}/plan.md`. Each task should have task definition, references to contracts to be used/implemented, deliverable definition and verification instructions.

Format each task as 
```
### [ ] Step: <task_name>
Task instructions
```

"Step:" prefix is important, do not omit it!

Status: Completed. Detailed implementation plan added below.

### [x] Step: Project Scaffolding (Pure JS)
Task instructions
- Definition: Create a static app under `docs/roster_cap_tool/` with `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and ES module files in `js/`. No bundler, no transpiler, no Node runtime required. Use standards-based web components/DOM manipulation.
- Contracts: Source layout now: `docs/roster_cap_tool/{index.html, css/, js/}`. No React/TS/Zustand.
- Deliverable: Loadable page from file:// and GitHub Pages; app bootstraps with placeholder panels.
- Verification: Open `docs/roster_cap_tool/index.html` locally or serve via `python3 -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000/docs/roster_cap_tool/`.

### [x] Step: Browser Test Page (Smoke)
<!-- chat-id: 1041fc8d-a4e1-40f7-9516-8882c0d454a9 -->
Task instructions
- Definition: Create `docs/roster_cap_tool/test.html` that programmatically simulates: load team → release a player → sign a FA; logs assertions to console for cap deltas.
- Contracts: Uses exported functions and store actions.
- Deliverable: One-click browser smoke test without Node tooling.
- Verification: Open `test.html` and check console output for PASS lines.

### [x] Step: Helper Verification Scripts & Fixtures

Task instructions
- Definition: Implement `scripts/verify_cap_math.py`, `scripts/smoke_roster_cap_tool.sh`, and `scripts/fixtures/cap_scenarios.json`. Generate `output/tiny_teams.csv` if missing for tiny tests.
- Contracts: Script I/O per spec; relies on same formulas as `capMath`.
- Deliverable: Scripts produce `output/cap_tool_verification.json` and smoke-check that `docs/roster_cap_tool/` contains required assets and serves via local http.server.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/verify_cap_math.py`; `bash scripts/smoke_roster_cap_tool.sh`.

### [x] Step: Styling, Accessibility, Responsive

### [x] Step: Fix bug
<!-- chat-id: 02298e49-e1af-4000-825c-83ad522c7258 -->

I open roster and see its empty, same time free agents are in place, fix this bug

Implementation notes:
- Root cause: `players.team` in `MEGA_players.csv` uses full team names (e.g., "Bengals"), while `selectedTeam` uses `teams.abbrName` (e.g., "CIN"). Active roster filter compared `p.team === selectedTeam`, yielding no matches.
- Fix: In `initState` normalize `player.team` to the team's `abbrName` using a mapping of `abbrName`/`displayName`/`teamName` → `abbrName`. Free agents remain unchanged.
- File changed: `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/state.js`.
- Verification: Load app and select any team. Active Roster lists players; Free Agents unchanged; actions work as before.

### [x] Step: add ability to setup draft pics
<!-- chat-id: ab4b0875-aa69-4113-b24f-1422282be294 -->

We don't have data on draft picks; let's set the ability to set up draft picks and calculate the approximate rookie reserve required.

Implementation notes:
- Added rookie reserve estimation math in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js`:
  - `estimateRookieYear1ForSlot(round, pickInRound)` and `estimateRookieReserveForPicks({1..7})` with a round-based linear scale.
- Extended app state in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/state.js`:
  - Persist per-team draft picks under `localStorage` key `rosterCap.draftPicks`.
  - New getters/setters: `getDraftPicksForSelectedTeam()`, `setDraftPicksForSelectedTeam()`, `getRookieReserveEstimate()`.
  - `getCapSummary()` now includes `rookieReserveEstimate` and `capAfterRookies`.
- New UI tab renderer `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/draftPicks.js`:
  - Per-round pick count inputs, estimated per-pick Year 1, per-round totals, and grand total.
  - Reset/default buttons; advisory note.
- Updated mounts:
  - `main.js` mounts `mountDraftPicks()` on load and on state changes.
  - `capSummary` now displays Rookie Reserve and Cap After Rookies.

Verification:
- Open `docs/roster_cap_tool/index.html` → Draft Picks tab:
  - Change counts; Rookie Reserve total updates and persists per team.
  - Cap Summary shows Rookie Reserve and Cap After Rookies reflecting the estimate.

### [x] Step: Reset button whipe roster
<!-- chat-id: 9d2fca8a-0f31-4716-b41a-98f16ea2d937 -->

Bug: Hitting Reset cleared the visible roster. Root cause was `baselinePlayers` stored from raw CSV (full team names), while current filters rely on normalized team `abbrName`. Reset replaced normalized players with raw baseline, causing Active Roster filter to match zero rows.

Fix implemented:
- In `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/state.js`, set `baselinePlayers` to a deep copy of the normalized `state.players` (not the raw `players` array). This ensures Reset restores the true default roster.

Verification:
- Load app, switch team, perform a release/sign. Press Reset. Active Roster returns to original list; Free Agents and cap summary revert to baseline. Draft picks remain unchanged.

### [x] Step: Visual bug in roster
<!-- chat-id: ee04d146-5b6f-4ca6-9469-7dcab0da45e3 -->

Fix: Table header appeared below the first player row due to an incorrect sticky offset in CSS (`th { top: calc(58px + 44px) }`). Since the table scrolls inside `.table-container` (overflow: auto), the header should stick at the top of that container, not offset for the page header/tabs.

Changes:
- Updated `docs/roster_cap_tool/css/styles.css` to set `th { position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 2; }` and removed the larger offsets in the responsive section.

Verification:
- Open Active Roster: header now renders as the first row and remains correctly sticky within the table container while scrolling.

### [x] Step: Make all table columns sortable
<!-- chat-id: 5fdd1b9c-3ae7-4d1a-8f22-a4b8b1e0c0e7 -->

Add full-table sorting across all headers for Active Roster and Free Agents.

Changes:
- Updated `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js` to:
  - Define header metadata with keys for every column.
  - Add click handlers to all headers to toggle sort direction.
  - Implement robust sort value mapping for each key (player name, cap hit, dead money, contract value, FA year, etc.).
  - Keep Action column sortable (groups by extension eligibility for Active; stable for FAs).

Verification:
- Click any header in Active Roster or Free Agents; rows re-sort accordingly; clicking again toggles sort direction.

### [x] Step: In projection the Roster cap for DAL
<!-- chat-id: 9467ffe8-6ca1-467f-b1f8-3f8bbfc6053e -->

Issue: DAL showed Roster Cap $321,560,000 and Cap Space -$17M in Projections (Year 1). Root cause: Year 1 used a straight sum of all non-FA DAL players’ `capHit` (66 players = $321.56M) and compared it to `capRoom` ($304.2M), ignoring the in‑game baseline totals (`capSpent`/`capAvailable`). That mismatch produced an impossible negative space mid‑season.

Fix implemented:
- Anchored Year 1 (current season) in `projectTeamCaps()` to team snapshot:
  - `totalSpent₀ = team.capSpent + deltaFromMoves`
  - `capSpace₀ = team.capAvailable − deltaFromMoves`
  - `deadMoney₀` reflects only new scenario moves; `rosterCap₀ = max(0, totalSpent₀ − deadMoney₀)`
- Left future years (Year 2+) as roster‑sum projections with conversion and dead‑money schedules.
- Added a UI note in Projections: “Year 1 is anchored to the in‑game snapshot (capSpent/capAvailable). Roster Cap is derived; Dead Money reflects only scenario moves.”

Files changed:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js` (Year 1 anchoring logic in `projectTeamCaps`)
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/projections.js` (explanatory note)

Verification:
- DAL totals now show `Cap Space` equal to the in‑game `capAvailable` for Year 1 and never negative; applying a release/sign adjusts by the move deltas. Future years remain projection‑based.

### [x] Step: Dead money
<!-- chat-id: 5dd9e963-f8d0-48b3-b800-6400bb0680d6 -->

Dead money is split across two years and displayed in the Dead Money tab. Added a manual baseline per-team editor (This Year and Next Year) with localStorage persistence. Ledger rows now include current and next year values; totals show moves-only and combined with baseline.

Changes:
- UI: `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/deadMoneyTable.js` now shows This Year, Next Year, Total columns, a baseline editor with Save, and totals.
- State: `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/state.js` added baseline dead money getters/setters and persistence under `rosterCap.deadMoneyBaseline`.
- Moves: `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/modals/releaseModal.js` and `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js` now record `penaltyCurrentYear`, `penaltyNextYear`, and `penaltyTotal` in the dead money ledger.

Verification:
- Open Dead Money tab. Enter baseline values and Save; they persist per team and totals update.
- Release/Trade a player; row shows both years; totals reflect changes.

### [x] Step: Add posobility to trade for the player
<!-- chat-id: a74fcb3f-75a0-4b6b-b167-24506a9355a1 -->

Implemented Trade In flow:
- Added header button to open Trade In modal.
- Search players across other teams; show acquiring Year 1 (salary only).
- On confirm: move player to selected team, set `contractBonus = 0`, set `capHit` to salary-only, and add `tradeIn` move so cap summary updates.
- Cap math: `simulateTradeIn()` and support for `tradeIn` in `calcCapSummary` and `projectTeamCaps`.

Verification:
- Open the app, click Trade In, search/select a player from another team. Confirm. Active Roster updates; Cap Summary reduces by the shown Year 1 amount. Projections show no bonus proration for the acquired player.

### [x] Step: Add possitions colors and filter
<!-- chat-id: 5d7392a6-eecc-4997-9f93-52aba35c66be -->

Implemented:
- Expanded position badge colors in `docs/roster_cap_tool/css/styles.css` for QB, RB/HB, FB, WR, TE, full OL (LT/LG/C/RG/RT), DL (LE/RE/DE/DT/DL/EDGE), LBs (LOLB/MLB/ROLB/OLB/LB), secondary (CB/FS/SS/S/DB), and specialists (K/P/LS).
- Added filter bars to Active Roster and Free Agents panels (`index.html`) and styled chips (`.filters-bar`, `.chip`).
- Added position filter state with localStorage persistence in `js/state.js` (`getPositionFilter`, `setPositionFilter`).
- Rendered filter chips and applied filtering in `js/ui/rosterTabs.js` for both tables; chips toggle per-position; “All/Reset” clears filter.

Verification:
- Open Active Roster and Free Agents: position chips render above tables; clicking chips filters rows; clearing shows all; selections persist across re-renders and tab switches. Badges display with the new colors.

### [x] Step: Contract over the years
<!-- chat-id: 96a4302b-16be-42e1-8309-3f39a7fd0a25 -->

Implemented approximate multi-year contract allocation to improve projections.

Changes:
- capMath: Enhanced `projectPlayerCapHits()` to derive out-year cap hits by distributing base salary (`contractSalary/contractLength`) and prorating bonuses (up to 5 years). When `contractBonus` is missing, infer proration from `capReleasePenalty` (treated as remaining bonus). When `contractSalary` is missing, infer base from current `capHit` minus proration.
- UI: Updated Projections note to clarify approximations and inference rules.

Files changed:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js`
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/projections.js`

Verification:
- Open `docs/roster_cap_tool/index.html` → Projections tab. Confirm:
  - Year 1 remains anchored to team snapshot.
  - Future years reflect base = totalSalary/length + bonus proration; players with missing fields still show reasonable out-year caps.
  - Smoke check players with zero `contractSalary`/`contractBonus` still contribute via inferred values.

### [x] Step: Dead Cap (Release) is incorect name
<!-- chat-id: 1e25f3b1-5802-4e0b-b2a1-b5e98a36a48e -->

Implemented label update:
- Active Roster table column renamed from "Dead Cap (Release)" to "Free cap after release" in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js:121` and row data-label in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/playerTable.js:204`.
- Placeholder header updated in `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/main.js:44`.
Verification: Open the app; Active Roster table now displays the new column label; sorting and values unchanged (still uses `capReleaseNetSavings`).

### [x] Step: Projections improvements
<!-- chat-id: 1e2e4cf1-844c-4b45-9b29-f082ff5311fb -->

Projections now account for Rookie Reserve:
- Next year (Y+1): uses user-configured Draft Picks rookie reserve.
- Out years (Y+2+): assumes 1 pick per round by default.
- Default picks set to 1/round when no config exists.

UI changes:
- Removed the Projections tab/panel.
- Added a projection strip to the header Cap Summary showing Y+1/Y+2/Y+3 Cap Space after rookies.

Tech changes:
- `capMath.projectTeamCaps(..., years, opts)` accepts `opts.rookieReserveByYear` and adds it to future-year spending (i>0).
- `state.getDraftPicksForSelectedTeam()` defaults to 1 pick per round.
- `capSummary` computes a 3-year projection with rookie reserve and renders badges.

### [x] Step: UI fixes
<!-- chat-id: 76a40b52-860c-4a9c-8d05-f7d486fa55f7 -->

- Colorize LEDGE/REDGE (EDGE color) and MIKE/SAM/WILL (LB color).
- Update player info to show OVR and Age (remove height/weight).

Implementation:
- CSS: badge classes added for `.pos-LEDGE`, `.pos-REDGE`, `.pos-MIKE`, `.pos-SAM`, `.pos-WILL`.
- Ordering: added these roles to `POSITION_ORDER` for better chip sorting.
- Data: normalized `playerBestOvr`/`playerSchemeOvr` in player rows.
- UI: player row meta now renders `OVR {value} · Age {n}`.

Verification:
- Badges for the new roles display with colors in Active/FA tables.
- Player meta shows like `OVR 88 · Age 27` instead of `28y · 76 · 266 lb`.

### [x] Step: Raise the cap by 9% each year
<!-- chat-id: 91b21747-59c3-43ff-b0ac-a811cc71063a -->

Implemented annual cap growth in projections.

Changes:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/capMath.js`: `projectTeamCaps` now applies a per-year cap growth rate (default 9%). For year i, `capRoom_i = capRoom_0 * (1 + rate)^i`. The function also accepts optional `opts.capGrowthRate` to override the default.
- Projections in the header now implicitly reflect the increased cap space for Y+1..Y+3 because `projectTeamCaps` returns year-specific `capRoom` and `capSpace`.

Verification:
- Open the app header projections and compare Y+1 cap space before/after a manual check: base cap ~304M becomes ~331M cap basis for Y+1; cap space reflects this growth after rookies and rollover adjustments.

### [x] Step: Calculate DAL Y+1 breakdown
<!-- chat-id: on-demand -->

Added helper script `scripts/calc_team_y1_cap.py` to compute per-player Year+1 cap for a team (mirrors projectPlayerCapHits) and aggregate totals. Includes optional rookie reserve, baseline next-year dead money, and a tunable re-sign reserve factor.

Verification:
- Run `python3 scripts/calc_team_y1_cap.py --team DAL --rookie-reserve 12600000 --resign-factor 0.35`.
- Confirms roster Y+1 ≈ $276.76M; with rookies and ~35% re-sign reserve, Y+1 cap space ≈ $1.25M (tunable to match in-game ~0.8M).

### [x] Step: Lets do validation of numbers and finde where we fucked up
<!-- chat-id: 972ff175-9735-4bd9-92dc-110b1e304291 -->

Actions taken:
- Ran data re‑export: `bash scripts/sync_data_to_docs.sh --all` (copied updated MEGA_*.csv into `docs/roster_cap_tool/data/`).
- Smoked local server: `bash scripts/smoke_roster_cap_tool.sh` (assets served OK).
- Validated DAL team row from updated CSV: `capRoom=304,200,000 capAvailable=830,000 capSpent=303,370,000`.
- Verified cap math checks: `python3 scripts/verify_cap_math.py` (15/15 passed).

Findings (Dallas):
- Year 1 Cap Space now anchors to team snapshot (capAvailable) and reads ~$0.83M, matching in‑game. The prior ~$68M issue came from summing roster caps; this was fixed earlier by anchoring Year 1 in `projectTeamCaps()` and using `calcCapSummary()` for the header.
- Roster sum (~$321M) + dead (~$18M) ≈ $339M is higher than team `capRoom` due to rollover handling in‑game; our UI reflects the authoritative `capAvailable` field, not recomputed totals, so current‑year space is accurate.
- Next‑year rookie reserve estimate remains close to reported (~$12.6M vs our ~$11.5M baseline); users can override via the Draft Picks tab.

Conclusion:
- After re‑export, Year 1 numbers for DAL are correct in the app (Cap Space ≈ $0.83M). No additional code changes required.

### [x] Step: Baseline Dead Money affect on prediction bug
<!-- chat-id: deb2ac94-9702-4105-bedd-3ad955be79ae -->

Implemented baseline dead money impact on projections:
- capMath: `projectTeamCaps` now applies `opts.baselineDeadMoneyByYear[0]` to Year 0 anchored totals (reducing cap space and rollover) and applies baseline dead money for all years, not only i>0.
- UI: Header projections now pass both This Year and Next Year baseline dead money: `[year0, year1, 0, 0]`.

Verification:
- In the Dead Money tab, set This Year and Next Year baseline amounts and Save. Header Y+1 projection updates immediately; increasing This Year reduces possible rollover and lowers Y+1 cap space; setting Next Year lowers Y+1 cap space directly. Persist across re-renders.

### [x] Step: Change Y1 and Y2 penalty
<!-- chat-id: 798c9a2b-e1b7-481c-a63e-784149bb81a3 -->

looks like there a bug in our data we showing penalty as low in year 1 and high in year 2, but in game it is opposite. Change it in our representation and calculations. So what we called yar 2 penalty must be year 1.

Also we recalculate the Cap as 9% increes, but game also has a bug, lets hardcode Year 2 salary cap as 324 mil year 3 as 334 mil and year 4 as 344

### [x] Step: Re-sign reserve
<!-- chat-id: 30472e5c-9532-48d7-9154-35f454b33830 -->

Implemented re-sign reserve in the Projections tab:
- Added re-sign reserve computation (same as header) and applied it to Y+1 via `extraSpendingByYear` in `projectTeamCaps`.
- Added a re-sign reserve slider and badge to the Projections controls; value persists in `localStorage` and triggers global re-render.
- Updated note to clarify re-sign reserve is applied to Y+1 totals.

Files changed:
- `docs/roster_cap_tool/js/ui/projections.js`

Verification:
- Open Projections tab. Adjust the “Re-sign reserve” slider; Y+1 Cap Space changes accordingly and matches the header’s projection strip.
