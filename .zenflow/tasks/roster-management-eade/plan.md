## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Requirements
<!-- chat-id: b01c9885-8b2a-4b9f-90ef-8425fe822330 -->

Your job is to generate a Product Requirements Document based on the feature description,

First, analyze the provided feature definition and determine unclear aspects.  For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
      - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details

Ask up to 5 most priority clarifications to the user. Then, create the document following this template:

```
# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]


## User Stories*


### User Story 1 - [Brief Title]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

## Requirements*

## Success Criteria*

```

Save the PRD into `{@artifacts_path}/requirements.md`.

Status: Completed. See `.zenflow/tasks/roster-management-eade/requirements.md`.

### [x] Step: Technical Specification
<!-- chat-id: df991ac4-d4f7-48af-aa97-dfd48302df78 -->

Based on the PRD in `{@artifacts_path}/requirements.md`, create a detailed technical specification to be used by a coding agent to implement the feature. Follow this template:

```
# Technical Specification: [FEATURE]

## Technical Context
Language/Version, primary dependencies, etc

## Technical Implementation Brief

Summarize key technical decisions for implementing the feature. Make sure they take into account the existing code as much as possible.

## Source Code Structure

## Contracts

Define addition or changes in data models, DB schemas, APIs, code interfaces etc

## Delivery Phases

Define several incremental deliverables for the feature. Each should be a minimal viable product testable end-to-end.

## Verification Strategy 

Define how the coding agent can verify each deliverable it creates. Provide instructions for the agent to perform the verification using available tools (lint/test commands, bash commands) and create helper scripts and tools for more complex result verification.
The verification for each deliverable should be executable by a coding agent using built-in capabilities (lint and test commands from the project, bash commands), pre-generated helper scripts or MCP servers. Research and add to the spec:

- MCP servers that should be installed to help the agent with the verification 

- helper scripts that need to be generated in the first phases of the plan to verify complex scenarios that can't be covered by the tests in the project's test framework(s)

- any sample input artifact(s) that are required for verification. Note if these artifacts can be a) generated by the agent; b) discovered by the agent on line; c) must be provided by the user.
```

Save the spec to `{@artifacts_path}/spec.md`.

Status: Completed. See `.zenflow/tasks/roster-management-eade/spec.md`.

### [x] Step: Implementation Plan
<!-- chat-id: 9ef309d5-3d2a-4e50-8e76-ac34563749e8 -->

Based on the technical spec in `{@artifacts_path}/spec.md`, create a detailed task plan and update `{@artifacts_path}/plan.md`. Each task should have task definition, references to contracts to be used/implemented, deliverable definition and verification instructions.

Format each task as 
```
### [ ] Step: <task_name>
Task instructions
```

"Step:" prefix is important, do not omit it!

Status: Completed. Detailed implementation plan added below.

### [x] Step: Project Scaffolding (Pure JS)
Task instructions
- Definition: Create a static app under `docs/roster_cap_tool/` with `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and ES module files in `js/`. No bundler, no transpiler, no Node runtime required. Use standards-based web components/DOM manipulation.
- Contracts: Source layout now: `docs/roster_cap_tool/{index.html, css/, js/}`. No React/TS/Zustand.
- Deliverable: Loadable page from file:// and GitHub Pages; app bootstraps with placeholder panels.
- Verification: Open `docs/roster_cap_tool/index.html` locally or serve via `python3 -m http.server` and visit `http://localhost:8000/docs/roster_cap_tool/`.

### [x] Step: Data Models (JS) & Validation
Task instructions
- Definition: Define JS JSDoc typedefs in `js/models.js` for `Team`, `Player`, `CapSnapshot`, `ScenarioMove`. Implement small validation/coercion helpers (number/boolean parsing) in `js/validation.js`.
- Contracts: Mirrors “Contracts > Data models”; replace Zod with lightweight manual validators.
- Deliverable: Exported typedefs and validators used across the app.
- Verification: Add a browser test page `docs/roster_cap_tool/test.html` that runs validation against sample rows and logs pass/fail to console.

### [x] Step: CSV Loader & Normalization
Task instructions
- Definition: Implement `js/csv.js` using PapaParse (CDN) to fetch and parse CSVs; normalize rows with `validation.js`; expose `loadTeams()` and `loadPlayers()` returning arrays.
- Contracts: Input files are served statically; normalization mirrors schema fields in PRD/spec.
- Deliverable: Data loads from `./data/MEGA_players.csv` and `./data/MEGA_teams.csv`; warning panel gets invalid row counts.
- Verification: Open `test.html` to execute loader smoke; or use browser devtools on `index.html` to view loaded counts and sample rows.

### [x] Step: Data Placement for GitHub Pages
Task instructions
- Definition: Copy CSVs into `docs/roster_cap_tool/data/` so GitHub Pages can serve them (Pages does not serve repo root). Add a small sync script `scripts/sync_data_to_docs.sh` to copy updated CSVs when needed.
- Contracts: Uses repo-root `MEGA_players.csv`, `MEGA_teams.csv` as source of truth.
- Deliverable: `docs/roster_cap_tool/data/MEGA_players.csv` and `docs/roster_cap_tool/data/MEGA_teams.csv` checked in.
- Verification: Access `docs/roster_cap_tool/data/MEGA_players.csv` in browser; CSV downloads successfully.

### [x] Step: Cap Math Library (Pure Functions)
<!-- chat-id: b67a3193-570c-43b2-a9b6-8084fd64ad8d -->

<!-- chat-id: 7833658b-714c-4997-817a-123985ac5db5 -->
Task instructions
- Definition: Implement `js/state.js` as a simple pub/sub store holding selected team, players, free agents, dead money ledger, and move history. Provide derived getters for cap summary and filtered lists.
- Contracts: Same selectors concept from spec but implemented as functions: `getCapSummary()`, `getActiveRoster()`, `getFreeAgents()`.
- Deliverable: Store initializes after CSV load; notifies listeners to re-render.
- Verification: Log state transitions in devtools; `test.html` can exercise selectors.

### [x] Step: Team Selector & Cap Summary Panel
<!-- chat-id: 77f1c5e4-7c52-4b76-90f1-654124cdf0de -->
Task instructions
- Definition: Implement `js/ui/teamSelector.js` and `js/ui/capSummary.js`; sticky header with progress bar; shows original/current cap, cap spent, cap space, and delta; updates on store changes.
- Contracts: Uses store getters and `calcCapSummary`.

- Deliverable: Two functional tables with sorting and row numbering.
- Verification: Manual sort checks; console logs for selected actions.

### [x] Step: Release Flow (Action + Modal)
<!-- chat-id: 19dc21bd-8878-4b86-92bd-bbde00603e6e -->
Task instructions
- Definition: Add Action dropdown with “Release”; implement a modal using `<dialog>` in `js/ui/modals/releaseModal.js` showing Dead Cap Hit, Cap Savings, and New Cap Space; on confirm apply move and update store.
- Contracts: `simulateRelease`, `ScenarioMove` (ReleaseMove); fields `capReleasePenalty`, `capReleaseNetSavings`.
- Deliverable: Releasing a player updates roster and Cap Summary in real time.
- Verification: Manual modal preview; console assert of cap increase equals previewed savings.

### [x] Step: Free Agent Signing Flow (Offer Modal)
<!-- chat-id: 256cba22-b39c-4559-b886-66e6558dffad -->
Task instructions
- Definition: Add “Make Offer” for FAs; implement `js/ui/modals/offerModal.js` with years/salary/bonus inputs and cap preview; block signing if `capAvailable < year1CapHit`; on confirm, sign player and mark `isFreeAgent = false`.
- Contracts: `simulateSigning`; warning if offer < 90% of desired terms.
- Deliverable: Signing updates Active Roster and Cap Summary; warning shown when low offer.
- Verification: Manual offer at desired values shows expected Year 1 Cap Hit and reduces cap accordingly.

### [x] Step: Dead Money & IR Tabs + Trade Quick
