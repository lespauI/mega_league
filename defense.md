## üéØ Player Spotlights

### Zaire Franklin (IND) - The Complete Package
The Colts linebacker put together a masterclass season, leading the league in fantasy points (55.00) while recording 34 tackles, 3 interceptions, and 2 defensive touchdowns. Franklin's ability to stuff the run, cover receivers, and create turnovers makes him the complete defensive player. His 75 INT return yards demonstrate his ability to turn defense into offense. At 7 years pro, Franklin has reached his peak and is the heartbeat of Indianapolis' defense.

### Tyrel Dodson (MIA) - The Ball Hawk
Dodson's league-leading 8 interceptions in 9 games is simply remarkable. With 103 INT return yards and a touchdown, he's a nightmare for opposing quarterbacks. His 52.00 fantasy points rank 4th overall, and his ability to create turnovers has transformed Miami's defense. Combined with 22 tackles and 4 deflections, Dodson is having a career year and proving to be one of the league's most valuable defensive playmakers.

### Oluwafemi Oladejo (TEN) - The Rookie Phenom
The Titans' rookie edge rusher is making an immediate impact with a league-leading 7.0 sacks in just 7 games. His 13 tackles demonstrate he's not just a pass rush specialist - Oladejo can hold up against the run as well. With 27.00 fantasy points as a rookie, he's the clear frontrunner for Defensive Rookie of the Year and has quickly become one of the league's most feared pass rushers.

### Minkah Fitzpatrick (MIA) - The Game Changer
The veteran safety continues to prove why he's one of the league's elite defenders. With 54.00 fantasy points (tied for 3rd), 5 interceptions, 85 INT return yards, and a touchdown, Fitzpatrick is a game-wrecker. His 30 tackles show he's not just a ball hawk - he's a complete safety who can do it all. Combined with Tyrel Dodson, Miami has the most dangerous secondary in the league.
