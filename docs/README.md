# Docs & Dashboards Overview

The `docs/` folder is the static site for the MEGA League project. All HTML pages can be opened directly (e.g., via `python3 -m http.server 8000`) or served via GitHub Pages. This guide groups the main dashboards by domain and shows which scripts and outputs power each page.

If you add a new dashboard under `docs/`, consider:
- Which CSV/JSON outputs it reads from.
- Which orchestrator or stats script should be mentioned as the primary way to refresh its data.
- Adding a short entry to the appropriate domain table above.
