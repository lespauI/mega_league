The seven postseason participants from each conference are seeded as follows:
The division champion with the best record
The division champion with the second-best record
The division champion with the third-best record
The division champion with the fourth-best record
The wild card club with the best record
The wild card club with the second-best record
The wild card club with the third-best record
The following procedures will be used to break standings ties for postseason playoffs and to determine regular-season schedules.

NOTE: Tie games count as one-half win and one-half loss for both clubs.

TO BREAK A TIE WITHIN A DIVISION
If, at the end of the regular season, two or more clubs in the same division finish with identical won-lost-tied percentages, the following steps will be taken until a champion is determined.

Two Clubs 

Head-to-head (best won-lost-tied percentage in games between the clubs)
Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the division
Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games
Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference
Strength of victory
Strength of schedule
Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed
Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed
Best net points in common games
Best net points in all games
Best net touchdowns in all games
Coin toss
Three or More Clubs

(Note: If two clubs remain tied after a third club or other clubs are eliminated during any step, the tiebreaker reverts to step 1 of the two-club format.)

Head-to-head (best won-lost-tied percentage in games among the clubs)
Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the division
Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games
Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference
Strength of victory
Strength of schedule
Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed
Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed
Best net points in common games
Best net points in all games
Best net touchdowns in all games
Coin toss
TO BREAK A TIE FOR THE WILD-CARD TEAM
If it is necessary to break ties to determine the two wild card clubs from each conference, the following steps will be taken:

If the tied clubs are from the same division, apply the division tiebreaker.
If the tied clubs are from different divisions, apply the following steps:
Two Clubs

Head-to-head, if applicable
Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference
Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games, minimum of four
Strength of victory
Strength of schedule
Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed
Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed
Best net points in conference games
Best net points in all games
Best net touchdowns in all games
Coin toss
Three or More Clubs

(Note: If two clubs remain tied after a third club or other clubs are eliminated, the tiebreaker reverts to step 1 of the applicable two-club format.)

Apply the division tiebreaker to eliminate all but the highest-ranked club in each division prior to proceeding to step 2. The original seeding within a division upon application of the division tiebreaker remains the same for all subsequent applications of the procedure that are necessary to identify the two wild card participants.
Head-to-head sweep (applicable only if one club has defeated each of the others or if one club has lost to each of the others)
Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference
Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games, minimum of four
Strength of victory
Strength of schedule
Best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed
Best combined ranking among all teams in points scored and points allowed
Best net points in conference games
Best net points in all games
Best net touchdowns in all games
Coin toss
When the first wild card team has been identified, the procedure is repeated to name the second wild card (i.e., eliminate all but the highest-ranked club in each division prior to proceeding to step 2). In situations where three or more teams from the same division are involved in the procedure, the original seeding of the teams remains the same for subsequent applications of the tiebreaker if the top-ranked team in that division qualifies for a wild card berth.

OTHER TIE-BREAKING PROCEDURES
Only one club advances to the playoffs in any tie-breaking step. The remaining tied clubs revert to the first step of the applicable division or wild card tiebreakers. As an example, if two clubs remain tied in any tiebreaker step after all other clubs have been eliminated, the procedure reverts to step 1 of the two-club format to determine the winner. When one club wins the tiebreaker, all other clubs revert to step 1 of the applicable two-club or three-club format.
In comparing records against common opponents among tied teams, the best won-lost-tied percentage is the deciding factor, since teams may have played an unequal number of games.
To determine home-field priority among division titlists, apply wild card tiebreakers.
To determine home-field priority for wild card qualifiers, apply division tiebreakers (if teams are from the same division) or wild card tiebreakers (if teams are from different divisions).
To determine the best combined ranking among conference teams in points scored and points allowed, add a team’s position in the two categories; the lowest score wins. For example, if Team A is first in points scored and second in points allowed, its combined ranking is “3.” If Team B is third in points scored and first in points allowed, its combined ranking is “4.” Team A then wins the tiebreaker. If two teams are tied for a position, both teams are awarded the ranking as if they held it solely. For example, if Team A and Team B are tied for first in points scored, each team is assigned a ranking of “1” in that category, and if Team C is third, its ranking will still be “3.”
