# Plan

1. Locate wild card games for Season 2026 (season index 1) in `MEGA_games.csv` and identify all wildcard matchups.
2. Pull team-level context (record, ELO, rankings, strengths) from `MEGA_teams.csv`, `mega_elo.csv`, and output CSVs like `output/team_rankings_stats.csv` and `output/team_aggregated_stats.csv`.
3. Pull player usage and key contributors from `output/team_player_usage.csv` and relevant stat CSVs (passing, rushing, receiving, defense).
4. Build per-game writeups with ESPN/Athletic-style narrative plus data callouts, including per-game wild card ranking callouts.
5. Write the final report to `wild_card_season_1.md`.
