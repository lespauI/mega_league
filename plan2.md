# Plan 2

1. Inventory extra data sources for richer game previews (rookies, defense leaders, team rosters, advanced rankings) and map them to the wild card teams.
2. Build per-team profiles with: rookie callouts, defensive impact leaders, offense/defense strengths, usage concentration, and X-factor candidates.
3. Update each wild card game section with deeper matchup notes, key player spotlights, and clearer narrative stakes.
4. Regenerate the report with expanded sections and write to `wild_card_season_1.md`.
