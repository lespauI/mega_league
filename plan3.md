# Plan 3

1. Gather extra datasets (power rankings roster, team aggregated stats, team rosters, special teams, trades, draft, playoff probabilities, team scenarios, and player stints) and build team-level lookup maps.
2. Expand matchup data blocks to include pass/rush offense vs defense ranks, coverage takeaways, pressure metrics, special teams, and roster strength/dev trait counts.
3. Expand team sections with aggregated totals, special teams, roster top OVRs/injuries, draft/trade notes, and multi-team contributors.
4. Regenerate `wild_card_season_1.md` with the richer data-only report.
