**Y-Axis:** `rush_tds`  
**Insight:** Power runners break tackles AND score TDs. Physical dominance at goal line.

## 15. Special Teams Field Position
**X-Axis:** `punt_net_avg` + `kickoff_touchbacks`  
**Y-Axis:** `win_pct`  
**Insight:** Combined special teams impact on field position. Hidden yards win games.

## 16. Pass Protection Breakdown Rate
**X-Axis:** `pass_att_per_game` (Dropback volume)  
**Y-Axis:** `sacks_allowed_per_game`  
**Insight:** More dropbacks = more sacks? Pass-heavy fatigue on offensive line.

## 17. Defensive Tackle Efficiency
**X-Axis:** `def_tackles`  
**Y-Axis:** `def_sacks` + `def_ints` (Big plays)

## Notes for Implementation

- Some correlations may require **calculated fields** (e.g., combined special teams score)
- Consider adding **conference filters** to all new graphs
- **RÂ² thresholds**: Strong (>0.5), Moderate (0.25-0.5), Weak (<0.25)
- Use **color coding**: Red = above trend (better), Blue = below trend (worse)
- Add **insight text** explaining what each quadrant means

## Future Enhancements

- **3D correlations**: Use size or color for 3rd dimension (e.g., wins)
- **Time-based filters**: First 8 games vs last 8 games to show trends
- **Player drill-down**: Click team logo to see contributing players
- **Preset buttons**: Quick filters for "Playoff Teams Only" or "Balanced Offenses"
