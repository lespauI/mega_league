# Consistency Score  
consistency_score = std_dev(weekly_ranks)

# Improvement Score
improvement_score = early_season_rank - late_season_rank

# Efficiency Score
off_efficiency = points_for_rank - total_off_yards_rank
def_efficiency = total_def_yards_rank - points_against_rank

# Complementary Score
complementary_score = (off_rank + def_rank) / 2
```

## Data Processing Updates

### Additional Calculations Needed
```python
# From MEGA_teams.csv
yards_per_point_off = offTotalYds / ptsFor
yards_per_point_def = defTotalYds / ptsAgainst
home_win_pct = homeWins / (homeWins + homeLosses)
away_win_pct = awayWins / (awayWins + awayLosses)
cap_efficiency = (teamOvr * totalWins) / capSpent
net_points = ptsFor - ptsAgainst

# Combine rankings and stats
rank_vs_yards_correlation = correlate(offTotalYdsRank, offTotalYds)
efficiency_score = (ptsForRank - offTotalYdsRank) + (defTotalYdsRank - ptsAgainstRank)
```
