# Team Statistics Visualization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines suggested statistics visualizations based on available MEGA CSV data files. The visualizations will follow the same scatter plot style as the SoS graphs, using D3.js with team logos, trend lines, and interactive tooltips.

---

## Data Sources

## Technical Implementation Details

### Chart Structure
Each visualization should follow the `docs/sos_graphs.html` pattern:

1. **Scatter plot with team logos** (30x30px images)
2. **Linear trend line** (least-squares regression)
3. **Mean lines** (dashed horizontal and vertical)
4. **Color-coded backgrounds**:
   - Red square: Above trend line
   - Blue square: Below trend line
5. **Interactive tooltips** showing:
   - Team name
   - X-axis metric value
   - Y-axis metric value
   - Win%
   - Delta from trend line
6. **Conference filter** (ALL / AFC / NFC)
7. **Responsive D3.js implementation**

### Data Aggregation Required
Since CSV files contain player-level data, we need to:
1. **Aggregate by team**: Sum/average metrics per team
2. **Join with MEGA_teams.csv**: Get logos, win%, conference
3. **Calculate derived metrics**:
   - Rates (per attempt, per game)
   - Ratios (TD/INT, YAC%, etc.)
   - Differentials (turnover margin)

## Example Metrics Formulas

```javascript
// TD Efficiency
td_per_attempt = (passTotalTDs + rushTotalTDs) / (passTotalAtt + rushTotalAtt)

// INT Rate
int_rate = passTotalInts / passTotalAtt * 100

// Sack Rate
sack_rate = passTotalSacks / (passTotalAtt + passTotalSacks) * 100

// Broken Tackle Rate
bt_rate = rushTotalBrokenTackles / rushTotalAtt

// Drop Rate
drop_rate = recTotalDrops / (recTotalCatches + recTotalDrops) * 100

// YAC Percentage
yac_pct = recTotalYdsAfterCatch / recTotalYds * 100

// Explosive Play Rate
explosive_rate = (rushTotal20PlusYds + recTotal20PlusYds) / total_plays * 100
```

## Success Metrics

Each visualization should help answer:
1. **Is there a correlation?** (trend line slope)
2. **Which teams are outliers?** (far from trend/means)
3. **What's the league average?** (mean lines)
4. **Which conference is stronger?** (filter + compare)
5. **What drives wins?** (X = Win% shows predictive power)

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Define visualization plan (this document)
2. â¬œ Create Python aggregation script for team-level stats
3. â¬œ Generate derived metrics CSV files
4. â¬œ Build HTML/D3.js visualization (start with Phase 1)
5. â¬œ Add interactive features
6. â¬œ Deploy to docs/ folder
